    <p>
        Hi, I'm Tim. I'm a nerd. Not just a nerd, but what some would describe, in the 1990's parlance, an Ã¼bernerd.
        If we're assigning labels, geek, Japan fan, and gamer would also apply, but labels are only one dimension of
        a multifaceted person.

        I've been a content creator since 2015, when I started a small Podcast called "Insert Coin Theater" with my
        friend Jorge. From there, I branched into live streaming under the same name. Streaming on Twitch and making
        Let's Play style videos on YouTube were my ultimate hobby, one that I pushed toward becoming a career. Once I
        made my move to Microsoft's Mixer platform (Beam at the time I joined), things were really looking up and
        accelerating. I began a new podcast called Mandatory Social Interaction Show (MSIS) with my content creating
        artist friend <a href="https://abstractionmusic.com" target="_new">Ben Burnes.</a> I started a company called
        RetroFizz with my content creating nerd friends, Sean and Tim T. Our primary goal was to create the first 24/7
        livestream with curated, specially made content exclusive to the Mixer Platform. We facilitated show scheduling,
        designed premiere dates and collaborated (and paid!) fellow creators to produce content for our channel. Things
        only fell apart because Mixer announced its closure, which dried up our only target market at the time (we had
        not yet had the chance to execute to Twitch). As such, we parted ways, a success in its own rite and a worthwhile
        experiment.

        Once Mixer dissolved, we found ourselves in the midst of a pandemic, and I found myself, in essence, starting fresh
        with my content. I was burnt out, on top of it. Working a fulltime job, on top of fulltime content creation for
        years on end, had taken its toll. I needed a break, and I needed something fresh. So, I rebranded as Timcade, moved
        to the Pacific Northwest, and joined a local LPFM radio station. This lead in turn to my current incarnation of
        content creation. I am seeking to find the intersection between all my interests: games, tech, and Japan. It's going
        to be a journey to find the sweet spot, but I'm hopeful you'll join me in discovering just what the intersecting
        point looks like.

        geeky topics. You may also find it worthwhile to <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/timhosey">connect with me on
